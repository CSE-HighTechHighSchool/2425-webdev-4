  Definition: Landslides are defined as rock, debris, or earth moving down a
  slope. </h1>
<h1>Formation: The formation of landslides comes from three factors:
  gravity, water, and friction. Gravity is the force that moves the rock,
  debris, and earth downhill. Landslides can be counteracted by both friction
  and the internal strength of the material, but landslides happen when gravity
  is stronger than either of these forces. When water is added to slopes, the
  ground becomes heavier and increases the gravitational force. Water also
  lessens the strength of materials on slopes and reduces the friction. Finally,
  the steepness of the slope affects friction. The steeper the slope, the less
  the friction, and the higher chance of a landslide happening.</h1>
